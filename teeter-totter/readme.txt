This folder contains different codes to control a teeter-totter that has a small propeller on each end. It also has an accelerometer on its axis to sense the current angle.

- follow_sensor: simple program to independently control the two DC by following the readings from the sensor (the sensor here is attached to the teeter-totter). It is an open-loop control to show how readings from sensor are transformed to horizontal angle and how the Arduino sends commands to the motors
